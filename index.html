        <h2>Dreams and Goals</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a child, I have always loved to explore and travel to places that I hadn't gone before. As such I quickly realized at a young age that I wasn't the type of person to just stay put in one place for long periods of time. I would quickly get bored of normality and the daily routine. I decided to pursue a career as a programmer and software development because it provides the ability to travel and work from anywhere in the world. It also provides a mix of peace and excitement because you will always job opportunities as long as you are driven to continue learning.   </p>
